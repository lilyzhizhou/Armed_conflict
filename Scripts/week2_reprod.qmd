## How is research presented? {.smaller}

How is research **presented**?

-   Slideshows

-   Journal articles

-   Books

-   Websites

These are ways to **advertise** your research! [@GandrudBook]

## Bridging the gap between research and advertisement {.smaller}

-   Your **research** is the

> "full software environment, code, and data that produced the results" [@Donoho2010]

-   **Research** and **advertisement** should be combined

## This week {.smaller}

#### We will cover some basic tips to make your research more **reproducible** in `R` and `RStudio`

- Set up your **project**

- **Read in** data 

- Start writing **reproducible** scripts

- Make a GitHub repo


## Project from RStudio {.smaller}

#### Create your [project](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects) in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
- File > New Project > ...

- 

- Create sub-folders to **organize** your project

- Separate folders for

  + code
  
  + data
  
  + results
  
  + presentation files
  
  + other documents

Rohan Alexander has a [great example](https://github.com/RohanAlexander/starter_folder) of a nicely laid out R project folder.


## Data gathering  {.smaller}

### Read in external data

Are you still doing this?

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
setwd("C:\\Users\\ayami\\Documents\\Talks\\Reproducibility\\data\\raw data")
repdata <- read.csv("mydata.csv", header = TRUE)
```

NOT REPRODUCIBLE!!!!!

- Doesn't work on a different machine

- `C:`, `D:`, or `P:`?

- `/`, `\`, or `\\` ?

- Can't output object to a different folder


## Data gathering  {.smaller}

### `here` package to the rescue!

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
library(here)
```

Directory is set to project root folder

```{r}
here()
```

Read in data from a sub-folder

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
rawdat <- read.csv(here("data", "raw data", "myrawdata.csv"), header = TRUE)
```

* Always a good idea to save the raw data in a safe folder
* Save a copy of cleaned/modified data for analysis

Output results to a different sub-folder
```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
write.csv(cleandat, here("data", "cleandata.csv"), row.names = FALSE)
```

## Data gathering  {.smaller}

### Or if you have an R project set up, the working directory is automatically the root directory


Read in data from a sub-folder

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
rawdat <- read.csv("data\raw data\myrawdata.csv", header = TRUE)
```

* Always a good idea to save the raw data in a safe folder
* Save a copy of cleaned/modified data for analysis

Output results to a different sub-folder
```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
write.csv(cleandat, file = "data\cleandata.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```



## Data cleaning

### My `create_cleandata.R` script

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
# Author: Aya Mitani
# Last updated: 2021-11-24
# What: Read in raw data, 
#         remove incidences with missing data, 
#         clean var1 and var2 variables, 
#         write new clean data
#----------------------------------------------------------------

rawdat <- read.csv(here("data", "raw data", "myrawdata.csv"), 
                   header = TRUE, na.strings=c(""))

# create new variables, exclude missing observations, 
# select relevant variables, etc.

# output new data 
write.csv(cleandat, here("data", "cleandata.csv"), row.names = FALSE) 
```


## Version control  {.smaller}

- In this course, we will implement version control though [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/)

- Git is a version control system that keeps a record of the changes to your files or projects
  +   We determine when Git takes a snapshop of the file or project
  +   We include a message along with the snapshop to remind ourselves what changes were made
  +   We can search and recover past versions of files and projects
  
- GitHub offers a friendly platform service to use Git

- Why use version control?

    1. enhances **reproducibility** by making it easier to share code and data (with others and with yourself);
    2. makes it easier to **collaborate**;
    3. improves **workflow** by encouraging systematic approaches; 
    
## Introduce yourself to Git {.smaller}

### Set your username and commit email address in Git
Open **Git Bash** (in Windows) or **Terminal** (in Macs) and type
```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
git config --global user.name "My Name"
git config --global user.email "myemail@email.com"
```

To confirm
```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
```

Or use the `usethis` package in **R**
```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
install.packages("usethis")
library(usethis) 

usethis::use_git_config(user.name = "My Name", user.email = "myemail@email.com")

# to confirm, generate a git situation-report, your user name and email should appear under Git config (global)
usethis::git_sitrep()
```

## Push to GitHub {.smaller}
* There are many different ways to create a new repo in GitHub, but as R users, it is easiest to keep using the `usethis` package

#### Initiate and commit the files
```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
usethis::use_git()
```

#### Push to GitHub
```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
usethis::use_github()
```

#### This will create the R project folder as a repo in your GitHub account!
* Go to your GitHub account and find your new repo which has the same name is your R project folder

## After the initial commit {.smaller}

* Once your project is live on GitHub, archive (or even delete) the original project on your machine 
* After your initial commit, any updates you make should be done using version control
* I like to create a "Version control" folder on my local machine 
* When you want to make any changes, copy the HTTPS from your GitHub Repo page

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("images/gitcopyrepo.png")
```

## Version control {.smaller}

### Open RStudio
* *New Project* > *Version Control* > *Git* 
* Paste HTTPS in *Repository URL*
* Give a name to the project 
  + I like to just use the original project name, but you can give it other names, e.g. `myproject_update2023`
* Enter the directory where you want to put your project

### Make your edits
* Remember to `check()` before pushing the new edits back onto GitHub

## Version control  {.smaller}

### Pull + Commit + Push

::: columns
::: {.column width="65%"}
* When you are ready to push your edits, click on the "Git" tab
* Click on "Pull" $\downarrow$  
  + You will likely get the message "Already up to date."
* Click on "Commit" and open the Git pop-up
* Check "Staged" box for all files you want to commit
* Write a Commit message, e.g. "Read in new data"
* Click on "Commit"
* Click on "Push" $\uparrow$
* Refresh your browswer and see the new commit on your GitHub Repo page
